# Scenario

You are a web developer for the Acme Software company. You are asked to build an advanced prototype of an
application that functions as a Gif browser. As the back-end doesnâ€™t exist, you are asked to use an API that
exist publicly.

# Mission

Your mission is to create a single-page web application and connecting to the Giphy API
(https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide).

# Requirements

Your project will be manually revised by an engineer according to the following requirements:

- The page should never reload.
- Provide a form to the user so they can perform a search against the database of Ghipy via the API.
- Show the results on the thumbnails in a logical way. A great quantity of results must load in a way that
  performance is considered. Allow the user to load more results and use pagination. Also, provide a
  way for the user to clear the results.
- Add a search history, allowing the user to clean it. Create a simple backend that stores and retrieves
  the search history in a database of your choice.
- Create code in a clean, readable way, allowing normal conventions.
- Develop and test using Chrome/Chromium browser. Your work will be revised with that browser.
- If you have any note or instructions about the exercise, please write them on the README.md
